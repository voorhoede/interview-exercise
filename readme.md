# Interview exercise

**Build a simple web site / web app with data from [our API](https://voorhoede-colibri-api.now.sh/)<sup>[1](#1)</sup>**.

We built an API to give access to our websiteâ€™s content via a [RESTful](https://voorhoede-colibri-api.now.sh/#restful-api) and a [GraphQL](https://voorhoede-colibri-api.now.sh/#graphql-api) interface. You can explore both APIs from within the browser. Your assignment is to use this API to build a new website or web app, anything you like, and by doing so demonstrate your skill and ingenuity to us.


When you're done, we'd like to be able to see the result in the browser as well as the source code.

We are interested to find out:

* The skills you have and the approach you take.
* What solution do you choose?
* Which libraries do you use and what did you write yourself?
* How does it work & look in the browser?

Please don't spend days on it, keep it simple! If you have any questions now or along the way, please do contact us. We are very eager to see what you come up with.

Good luck and have fun!
