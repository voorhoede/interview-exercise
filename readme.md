# Interview exercise

**Build a simple web site / web app with data from the [`files/`](files/) directory**.

We've put the source of 3 of our blog posts in the [`files/`](files/) directory:

* 9 ways to improve collaboration between developers and designers
* Progressive Enhancement for JavaScript App Developers
* Why our website is faster than yours

Each post is available in 3 formats: Markdown, JSON and HTML.

You're free to approach this however you like. You can use the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/), The [Rawgit CDN](https://rawgit.com/), use this repository as a dependency in your project, or copy the files, or whatever you think is best. 

When you're done, we'd like to be able to see the result in the browser as well as the source code.

We are interested to find out:

* The skills you have and the approach you take.
* What solution do you choose?
* Which libraries do you use and what did you write yourself?
* How does it work & look in the browser?

Please don't spend days on it, keep it simple! If you have any questions now or along the way, please do contact us. We are very eager to see what you come up with.

Good luck and have fun!
